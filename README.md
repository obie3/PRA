This project was bootstrapped with [EXPO CLI]

It's a boilerplate for bootstrapping CRNA or EXPO Apps.

ATM it contains minimum screens and route configuration.

## Requirements
This project requires Expo. Whether you're running it on a real device or in a simulator, you'll need to download the Expo Client for the respective environment [android/ios].

You'll find the Expo guide & docs [here](https://docs.expo.io).

## Setup
* Navigate to your terminal
* Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/obie3/PRA.git` in your terminal
* Navigate into the directory where the cloned project is located in your terminal
* Run `cd PICTDA.git` in your terminal
* Next run `yarn install`  or `npm install` in your terminal to install dependencies
* Run `yarn start` in your terminal to start the React Native packager - so that you can run/access the app
* Follow the instructions that show up in your terminal to run the app in any environment of your choice


## Note

This boilerplate is still a WIP,  PR's with Redux integration and basic forms are welcomed.

Cheers!
